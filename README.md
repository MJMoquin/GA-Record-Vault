## Welcome to my Unit 2 project: [Record-Vault](https://mjm-record-vault.herokuapp.com/)

### Description:
This app will help you keep track of your vinyl/cd collection. It will allow you to search for and add your albmums from a vast database. Once an album is added it will automatically populate with the album cover, track listing and brief summary of the record.
